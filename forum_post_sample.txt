Another pack from the Seasons series featuring spring themed levels. This is final map pack to the said series and there won't be anymore of those.

Is there a difference in final seasons pack? A major one: 1.5 version only.
How many there are differences? Pretty a lot, but not that much as expected. One of features is almighty powerful scripting engine supporting endless amount of creative ideas/possibilities. I will not spoiler some of this pack's features, you'll discover them on your playthrough.
